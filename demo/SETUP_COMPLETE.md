# ✅ Authentication Setup Complete!

Playwright authentication has been successfully configured for your EduPlatform demo app.

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ NextAuth Configuration Updated
**File:** `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Added test credentials provider support
- Automatically uses test auth when `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST=true`

### 2. ✅ Test Credentials Provider Created
**File:** `lib/auth.test.ts`
- Credentials provider for testing (email/password)
- Supports admin, operator, and user roles
- Only works in non-production environments

### 3. ✅ Signin Page Enhanced
**File:** `app/signin/page.tsx`
- Added credentials form (only shows in development)
- Keeps existing Google OAuth support
- Test accounts clearly labeled

### 4. ✅ UI Components Added
**Files:** `components/ui/input.tsx`, `components/ui/label.tsx`
- Created Input and Label components for the signin form

### 5. ✅ Playwright Configuration Updated
**File:** `playwright.config.ts`
- Added setup project for authentication
- Created separate project for authenticated tests
- Tests run with proper session state

### 6. ✅ Authentication Setup Script
**File:** `tests/auth.setup.ts`
- Runs before authenticated tests
- Saves session to `.auth/user.json`
- Reused across all authenticated tests

### 7. ✅ Package Scripts Added
**File:** `package.json`
- `npm run test:e2e:auth` - Run tests with authentication
- `npm run test:e2e:ui:auth` - Run with UI mode
- `npm run test:e2e:update` - Update snapshots

### 8. ✅ Dependencies Installed
- `cross-env` - Cross-platform environment variables

### 9. ✅ Documentation Created
- `PLAYWRIGHT_AUTH_SETUP.md` - Quick start guide
- `tests/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.auth/` directory

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Tests with Authentication

```bash
# Regular test run
npm run test:e2e:auth

# With UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui:auth

# Update snapshots
npm run test:e2e:update
```

### Test Accounts

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| admin@test.com | test123 | admin |
| operator@test.com | test123 | operator |
| user@test.com | test123 | user |

### Manual Login (Browser)

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/signin`
3. Use any of the test accounts above
4. You'll be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

## 📝 Re-enable Skipped Tests

Now that authentication is working, you can re-enable the skipped tests in:

**File:** `tests/e2e/admin-dashboard.spec.ts`

Change these tests from `test.skip(` to `test(` and rename the file to `admin-dashboard.auth.spec.ts`:

```typescript
// Before:
test.skip('should load dashboard page without errors', async ({ page }) => {

// After:
test('should load dashboard page without errors', async ({ page }) => {
```

These tests will now run with authentication!

## 🔍 Verify Setup

Test the signin page manually:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: In another terminal, navigate to signin
# Open http://localhost:3000/signin in your browser

# You should see:
# - Email and password fields (test mode)
# - "Sign in with Test Credentials" button
# - Google OAuth button below
```

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Test manually**: Visit `/signin` and login with `admin@test.com` / `test123`
2. **Run tests**: Execute `npm run test:e2e:auth`
3. **Re-enable tests**: Convert skipped admin tests to `.auth.spec.ts` files
4. **Add more tests**: Create new authenticated test scenarios

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests fail with "Signin form not found"
- Make sure dev server is running
- Check that `/signin` page loads correctly
- Verify Input and Label components are working

### "Missing Google OAuth credentials" error
- This is expected! Run tests with `npm run test:e2e:auth` (sets `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST=true`)
- The test credentials provider will be used instead of Google OAuth

### Authentication not persisting
- Check that `.auth/user.json` is created after setup runs
- Verify `playwright.config.ts` has the authentication projects configured

### Can't see credentials form
- Make sure `NODE_ENV` is not set to 'production'
- The form only shows in development mode

## 📖 Documentation

- **Quick Start**: `PLAYWRIGHT_AUTH_SETUP.md`
- **Full Docs**: `tests/README.md`
- **Auth Config**: `lib/auth.test.ts`

## ✨ What's Next?

Your E2E tests are now ready for authenticated scenarios! You can:

1. Test admin dashboard features
2. Test user role-based access
3. Test navigation in authenticated areas
4. Test logout flows
5. Add more test users with different roles

Happy testing! 🎉
